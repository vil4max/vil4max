## About

iOS Software Engineer solving scalability and code reuse problems in e-commerce, real-time services, and fintech.
I help companies eliminate code duplication, reduce technical debt, and enable parallel development through **modular SDK architectures**.

**Problems I solve:**
- **Code duplication across multiple apps** → Create shared SDKs that power 3+ products with multi-brand theming (Kapital Bank: Birmarket, Birbank, M10)
- **Monolith scalability issues** → Lead monolith-to-module migrations, breaking down large codebases into 12+ core modules and 50+ feature modules (Umico marketplace)
- **Legacy UIKit maintenance burden** → Migrate critical flows to SwiftUI, improving maintainability and development velocity
- **No reusable components** → Architect modular SDKs using SPM, enabling code reuse across 10+ modules (Drinkit ordering platform)

I work with **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, **UIKit** and specialize in **Clean Architecture**, **MVVM-C**, and **Dependency Injection** patterns.
My experience spans startups and complex multi-app ecosystems, owning features end-to-end from early versions to production-ready SDK modules.

I'm focused on architecture, performance and product impact, with deep experience in **e-commerce platforms**, **marketplaces**, **subscriptions**, **loyalty systems**, and **real-time ordering services**. I also actively explore
how AI and new development tools can improve engineering workflows.
